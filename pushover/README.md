# Pushover

This plugin allows to send notifications via Pushover.

## Usage

When setting up nymea for the Pushover service, you need to register the application inside the Pushover service
at https://pushover.net/. The created token will be called token or application Token. Inside your Pushover app 
and your account you can also find your personal user token. To send a message to multiple users at once you can 
use a group that you can create inside Pushover as well. The user or group token are necessary for configuration
as well
